# Easydata-MD
Easydata-MD is a Monthly Dataset for Macroeconomic Research on Pakistan - We have openly provided this dataset to students, academics and professional researchers and organizations from around the world to motivate a competitive research culture on Pakistan's economy. We aim to achieve this target by encouraging people to use this database, which will allow use of common sample and common variables to anyone interested in conducting research on Pakistan's economy. We will keep expanding this database from its base version available in table in the appendix of our paper titled "Easydata-MD: A Monthly Dataset for Macroeconomic Research on Pakistan" published in Lahore Journal of Economics, and available at: https://lahoreschoolofeconomics.edu.pk/assets/uploads/lje/Volume28/03_Ateeb_Akhter_Hassan_Raza_and_Mohsin_Waheed.pdf

# How will the data be updated! 

We are excited to share that the original dataset is available in the repository and can be readily used for any macroeconomic analysis on Pakistan's economy. Furthermore, we will be adding more variables to this dataset overtime. The next update of data will be available on July 15, 2024. After that the data will be updated at the end of each quarter, that is 15th day after the end of each calendar quarter. 

# IMPORTANT NOTE ON UPDATES ON DATASET - Updated on July 21, 2025

It was observed that most of the time-series included in the dataset were being updated by the SBP with a delay, which means in 3 month's time only a few series will have 1 additional observation. Therefore, going forward this dataset will be updated in July and January each calendar year.

# More exciting news! 

The Easydata-MD will be available in R and Python through a single command, which will be built into the R package (EasyDataR) and Python library (EasyDataPy). So stay tuned!
